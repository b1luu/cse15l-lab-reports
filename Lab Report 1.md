Step 2: Locate Your CSE15L Account by clicking the link here: [Link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). Type in your UCSD username and Student ID. Once you are logged in, under section **Additional Accounts** you will find your CSE15L username and copy the username. 


Step 3: Type in the terminal and write ` ssh [Username (paste what you copied previously here)] + @ieng6.ucsd.edu ` followed by pressing **Enter**
> Your command should look similar to this: ` ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu ` where zz is used to create a general instance.
